    <p>Hey! My name is Joshua Mejia. I go to school at Queens Technical High School. I'm in an ad design class and I work with Code Nation. We worrk with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I'm learning a lot so far!</p>
  <p>In my free time, I like to do many activities. I like to play and watch sports such as hockey, american football, and futbol. My favorite sport to play is basketball since it only requires a ball and some friends. You don't even need friends to play it! Another thing I like to do is photography. Whenever I like to take picture of nature and people.</p>
